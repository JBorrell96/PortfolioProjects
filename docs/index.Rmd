## Background: Google DA Capstone Project for certification
Elected to take up role as junior data analyst working with marketing analyst team at Cyclistic,
a bike-share company in Chicago. Cyclistic's program features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking
stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart from its competitors by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles and
cargo bikes to those who cannot ride a standard two-wheel bike. The majority of their riders opt for traditional
bikes with about 8% of riders using their alternative assistance options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride
for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes
are referred to as casual riders whereas customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Therefore, my team was tasked in finding out how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic
executives must approve these recommendations, so our insights must be polished and backed by compelling data and detail-oriented
clear data vizualizations.

This project will be broken up into 6 stages encompassing the Data Analytics stages:

- Ask: Identify the business task and determine the key stakeholders.
- Prepare: Collect the data, identify how it's organized and determine the credibility of the data.
- Process: Select the tool for data cleaning, check for errors and document the cleaning process.
- Analyze: Organize and format the data, aggregate the data so that it's useful, perform calculations and identify trends and
relationships.
- Share: Use design thinking principles and data-driven storytelling approaches, present the findings with effective vizualization.
Ensure the analysis has answered the business task.
- Act: Share teh final conclusion and the recommendations.

### **Ask:**

Business Task:
Recommend marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members by better understanding how annual members
and casual riders use Cyclistic bike services differently

Stakeholders:
Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and my current manager.
Cyclistic executive team: A detail-oriented executive team who will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program
Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps
guide Cyclistic's marketing strategy.


### **Prepare:**

For this project, I will use the public data of Cyclistic's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. This data is provided
to me through Coursera under the Google Data Analytics Certificate program pulled from a course document link providing this [index](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

I downloaded the ZIP files containing the .csv files from the link above. I will be uploading this file utilizing R Markdown in R
and filtering the knitted .html file onto Github due to a slight favoritism to the site for version control. I will be analyzing the
previous 12 months worth of data starting from April 2023 and going all of the way back to March 2022.

In the first stages I utilized Google Sheets to try to upload the data but found the amount of information being imported Google Sheets
could not handle. I then switched to Microsoft Excel to at least get a glimpse into the data's structure and find out what data I would be
working with. Information contained in each .csv file was as follows: ride id, rideable type, start and end times, start and end station ids,
latitude and longitude of start and end stations and start and end stations.

### **Process:**

I will be using the R Programming language for most, if not all, of my organization and data cleaning.
I will be using the following R libraries:


```{r}
#Load the tidyverse, lubridate, data.table, readr and ggplot2 packages
##Excellent package for all around cleaning and manipulation
library(tidyverse)

##For customization and manipulation of date/time
library(lubridate)

##For dataframe/table manipulation, also allows for faster read in time
library(data.table)

##For quick read/write in of .csv files
library(readr)

##For plotting/visualization later on
library(ggplot2)

##For introducing more complicated viz
library(plotrix)
```

I then worked on importing my data and created dataframes to call upon for later rbinding into 1 single data frame.

```{r}
#Set the working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Jon/Documents/GitHub/PortfolioProjects/docs")

##Start with clear environment
rm(list = ls())
```
```{r}
##Assign simple operators df = dataframe 1-12 using data.table::fread()
##Noticed this had fastest output compared to other read options based on tests
##Data frame read in ~15 seconds
df1 <- data.table::fread("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df2 <- data.table::fread("202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df3 <- data.table::fread("202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df4 <- data.table::fread("202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df5 <- data.table::fread("202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df6 <- data.table::fread("202209-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df7 <- data.table::fread("202210-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df8 <- data.table::fread("202211-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df9 <- data.table::fread("202212-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df10 <- data.table::fread("202301-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df11 <- data.table::fread("202302-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df12 <- data.table::fread("202303-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

```{r}
##Verify structure and data types of data frames
str(df1)
str(df2)
str(df3)
str(df4)
str(df5)
str(df6)
str(df7)
str(df8)
str(df9)
str(df10)
str(df11)
str(df12)
```


```{r}
##Notice some issues with data types. We can rbind rows,cols to make one table and clean it after
bike_rides <- rbind(df1, df2, df3, df4, df5, df6, df7, df8, df9, df10, df11, df12)
```

```{r}
##Check structure of new dataset bike_rides
str(bike_rides)
```


```{r}
##Check for missing values within dataset and clean data if %error is low enough to not impact
##overall analysis
colSums(is.na(bike_rides))
```


```{r}
##This will output missing end_lats and end_lng
bike_rides <- na.omit(bike_rides)
```


```{r}
##Comparitively this removed 10k rows out of the 5.8 million records
##For start station id and end station id we will not coerce into int/numeric
##due to some station ids having characters in them

##Date format was not an issue. Proper date format for start and end at times
##Work on coercing date into sections, date, month, day, year and day of week, this will
##allow for aggregation of data based on these values
bike_rides$date <- as.Date(bike_rides$started_at)
bike_rides$month <- format(as.Date(bike_rides$date), "%B")
bike_rides$day <- format(as.Date(bike_rides$date), "%d")
bike_rides$year <- format(as.Date(bike_rides$date), "%Y")
bike_rides$day_of_week <- weekdays(bike_rides$date)
```


```{r}
##Next we are going to verify unique values in membership type and rideable type
unique(bike_rides$member_casual)
unique(bike_rides$rideable_type)
```


```{r}
##Membership types verified values as member and casual
##rideable types verified values as electric, classic and docked

##Check for TEST stations that may lead to inaccurate conclusions
unique(bike_rides$start_station_name[grep("TEST", bike_rides$start_station_name)])
##Output generated no test stations
```


```{r}
##Breakdown creation of a new dataframe based on start location, by pulling start station name
##long and lat.
bike_rides_stations <- bike_rides[,c(5,9,10)]
```


```{r}
##Since I will be trying to find out station popularity we can remove any duplicates for now
##and count total number of stations for overall encompass of data spread location
bike_rides_stations <- bike_rides_stations[!duplicated(bike_rides_stations$start_station_name),]

NROW(unique(bike_rides_stations))
##Verified there are 1700 station
```


```{r}
##Moving on to calculate ride length in minutes breakdown difference in time end and start
##to find ride_length time
bike_rides$ride_length <- difftime(bike_rides$ended_at, bike_rides$started_at)

##Then convert hour time to minute time /60 new format will be minutes and decimal will be seconds
bike_rides$ride_length <- bike_rides$ride_length/60

##Round trip to 2 decimal places for exact minutes/seconds duration for ride length
bike_rides$ride_length <- round(bike_rides$ride_length, 2)
```


```{r}
##Data conversion of ride_length to numeric to aggregate
bike_rides$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(bike_rides$ride_length))

##Remove any observations that are below 0/errors in input
bike_rides <- filter(bike_rides, ride_length > 0)
```


```{r}
##Use summary() to quickly find mean, median, min, max for ride_length by rider type
summary(bike_rides$ride_length)
```

```{r}
##Output for summary in comparison will be in minutes with casual members on average riding
##double the time than members
bike_rides %>% 
        group_by(member_casual) %>% 
        summarise(avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length), median_ride_length = median(ride_length), max_ride_length = max(ride_length), min_ride_length = min(ride_length))
```


```{r}
##Next I will organize the days of the week and as well as month. Will use the levels function and assign
##attributes to reflect days in week and months in year
bike_rides$day_of_week <- ordered(bike_rides$day_of_week, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", 
"Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
bike_rides$month <- ordered(bike_rides$month, levels = c("January", "February", "March", "April","May",
"June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"))
```


```{r}
##Average ride time per day in week members vs. casual users
aggregate(bike_rides$ride_length ~ bike_rides$member_casual + bike_rides$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
##Conclusion stays the same from earlier. Average ride times throughout the week are higher
##for casual members.
```


```{r}
##Another comparison summarising number of riders throughout week members vs. casual users
bike_rides_by_day <- bike_rides %>% 
        group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
        summarise(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
        arrange(member_casual, day_of_week)
head(bike_rides_by_day, 14)
##Output reveals that casual riders tend to ride more often on weekend days. Members ride more
##throughout the week. Casual riders spend more time in minutes riding overall
```


```{r}
##Turn off scientific notation and plotting will begin for quick analysis
options(scipen = 999)

##Create a data set of top 10 routes for casual riders
popular_ride_route_top10 <- head(arrange(popular_ride_route, desc(number_of_rides)), 10)
head(popular_ride_route_top10, 10)
##Clearly it can be seen that there is heavy use of the Streeter Dr. & Grand Ave route = 10346 where the 2nd
##highest number of routes was DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St.
```

```{r}
##Verify by filtering number of rows in the bike_rides_casual dataset to get count. I will verify the top used route

```

### **Share:**

The average ride duration of ~21 minutes for casual rider is almost 2 times higher compared to that of member rider of ~12 minutes.

The average ride duration for member rider shows consistency throughout the week with Monday to Friday at ~12 minutes with a slight increase to ~14 minutes over Saturday and Sunday.

The average ride duration for casual rider is almost consistent throughout the week with Monday to Friday at ~20 minutes; with a slight increase to ~24 minutes on Sunday.

The total number of rides is almost constant throughout 7 days for member riders whereas ~37% of the total ride for casual riders are on Saturday and Sunday only.


```{r}
pie3D(slices_casual_week, labels = lbls_casual_week, explode = 0.1, col= terrain.colors(2), main = "Casual Riders Breakup by Day: Sat-Sun Vs Mon-Fri")
```

June to August constitute to a little less than 50% of the overall total rides for both casual and member riders; with ~49% for casual riders and ~36% for member riders. If we take into account that there is surge within these 3 months which we can see with our visualizations and we take into account that these 3 months are only a quarter of the year, this percentage of riders with this surge is substantial and should be focused on.

```{r}
pie3D(slices_casual_month, labels = lbls_casual_month, explode = 0.1, col= terrain.colors(2), main = "Casual Riders Breakup by Month: June-August Vs Rest of the Year")
```

### **Act:**
The high level recommendations for increasing the number of rider membership are:

A little less than 50% of the casual riders use Cyclictic over a span of 3 months from June to August which overall has heavier weight to it considering less than half of total rides are covered in a quarter of the year. We can focus efforts in marketing during big events in Chicago targeting regular weekdays for casual riders due to them utilizing services the most during these days overall. Efforts can be focused towards the top 10 stations and their surrounding area:
*A weekly, monthly and quarterly membership schemes
*Increasing the number of bikes' availability over the period of these 3 months

Design campaign to promote the usage of bikes regularly by highlighting the health and environmental benefits.

Collaborate with organizations and companies in promoting the usage of bikes by offering various membership schemes; this will be a win-win situation for both.

Increase the number of classic bikes availability from December to March as the total number of casual rides with electric bikes were high during these months. Design campaigns to promote the electric bike's usage by highlighting its benefits and sustainability for travel.

Further analysis needs to be carried out to find insights to reduce the average ride duration of casual riders as currently although ~43% of the total rides are done by casual riders but the average ride duration is ~3 times more than the member riders. And to increase the availability of bikes; need to shorten the ride duration. Also noticed some abnormalities within data set that were cause for concern such as extended ride length times exceeding hours in ride time. Would need to verify if this was accurate.
